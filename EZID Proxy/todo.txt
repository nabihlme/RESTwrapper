docker run williamyeh/wrk:latest -c 100 -t2 



State of Unit Testing

Understanding of overhead at fullstacks
EZID batch interface
    - Berkleedb?

Get a take on how long it would take 
    - Stress test 1,10,100,1000, ... minids
      Give up when it takes too long!
    - Compare directly to EZID

Prepare for Talk
    - Slides about what you did

Form Vaildation
    -if passed an ark it must EXIST

Final testing,
Build into docker run, and then
Redeploy and document

Writing a load balencer to spawn more fargate instances?
    -NIH 

Extra Credit
=======================================================
Read JSON-LD designing JSON-LD apis?
    - need to understand role of contexts in semantic web applications

One Large Template
    Takes the smaller argument


Add schema.org metatags in html?
    - Notes on Microdata

4.0 Set Up neo4j to injest new id's
    Dump to S3 bucket

    Read out all of neo4j to cystoscape.js
    Table, with tab indented

5.0 Get some scripts ready for Jared for a bulk upload in Ipython
    - when halfway done, send email asking for an example metadata file, also send requirements


Notes - should profile have object subtypes, so i can tell the type of object when I request it?
    profile = 'dcppc' or profile = 'dcppc.DatasetUnpublished'

Big To Do

Attribute Validataion 
=====================================
    make sure data type is correct
        - identifiers follow regex's for arks, uuids, or doi's
        - arks that point to are valid
            - def ValidId(PassedID):
                response = requests.get('ezid.clib.../'+PassedId)
                if CheckResponse(Response):

                else:
                    MintID? Return Error Messages -> requires different metadata to mint new IDs
        - dates have a specific format


Authentication after Landing Page -> much later
====================================
    - I want this file/dataset -> pass authentication to get the location
        - Tokens and authentication is easy
    - Paperwork and humans stand in the way 
    - If you dont have access -> heres what to do!
